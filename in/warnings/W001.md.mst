This warning will appear when you attempt to assign to an object property named "hasOwnProperty":

```js
object.hasOwnProperty = function () { }
```

```js
object['hasOwnProperty'] = null
```

It will also appear when you try to define an ES6 getter or setter with that name:

```js
class foo {
	get hasOwnProperty() {
	}
}
```
